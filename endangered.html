    <h3>Giant Panda</h3>
    <p class="large2 violet"> Since the late  1980s, Giant Pandas have encountered hostile and stringent habitat protections and poaching. Which is still happening today. China has the most number of Giant Pandas in wild population, which could be estimated to around 2500 Pandas.<br> <br>
    
    In addition, Pandas are still subject to diseases, occasional predation, and starvation when large swathes of the bamboo on which they feed completes its life cycle and dies.-"Britannica"
    </p>

    <h3>Orangutan</h3>
    <p class="large3 green"> The estimated remaining Orangutans in the world is around 60,000! Experts believe that in 50 years Orangutans in the wildlife will become extinct.-"Orangutan.com"  <br>

    The Bornean orangutan differs in appearance from the Sumatran orangutan, with a broader face and shorter beard and also slightly darker in color.  <br> <br> The three types of endangered orangutans are recognized, each localized to different parts of the island: <br> 1.Northwest Bornean orangutans  2.Northeast Bornean   3.Central Bornean orangutans.-”Worldwildlife.org” 
    </p>


    <h3>Sea Otter</h3>
    <p class="large4 violet">The luxurious waterproof coat that insulates sea otters from the chilly waters that they inhabit almost led to its extinction. A target of the commercial fur trade, the species was almost wiped out, with only some 2,000 of an estimated 300,000 left by 1911. 
    <br>  
    Eventhough, the 'Marine Mammal Protection Act', has helped sea otter populations to recover a estimate of a third of their earlier numbers. Sea others are still exposed and vulnerable to predator attacks from 'Killer Whales' and toanthropogenic factors such as oil spills.-"Britannica"
    </p>

    <h3>Blue Whale</h3>
    <p class="large5 green"> In this planet there are less than 25,000 Blue Whales left. Blue Whales are the largest species known in the world. The current population is thought to have been reduced by up to 90% by whaling in the 20th century. Commercial hunting of the Blue Whale was ultimately banned in 1966. However, this still happens illegally. <br>-"Britannica"
